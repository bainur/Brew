Plugins Installed

Brew comes with a few commonly used plugins installed and already setup.

Authlogic
We use Authlogic as authentication system.

Will Paginate
We use will_paginate in pretty much every project we use, so Brew comes with it pre-installed.

Rspec & Rspec-rails

Cucumber

Exception Notifier
You don’t want your applications to crash and burn so Exception Notifier is already installed to let
you know when everything goes to shit.

Asset Packager
Packages up your css/javascript so you’re not sending 143 files down to the user at the same time. Reduces
load times and saves you bandwidth.
Routes

AppConfig
There is a app_config.yml file that contains site-wide stuff. The site name, url and admin email are all used
in mailers, so you don’t need to worry about editing them.

Database YAML
The database.yml defaults to sqlite3 but also contains the settings for MySQL in comments so you can switch
over easily.

Capistrano Recipe
Brew comes ready to rock capistrano. The recipe that is setup is based on using git and passenger. It’s ready
to go with multistage deployments. It deploys to the production config by default, so if you don’t need it
you can ignore it. Just update config/deploy/production.rb with your deployment settings.

More info on capistrano-ext/multistage deployments can be found here: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/7/23/capistrano-multistage
Uses the Database for Sessions

Brew is setup to use the database to store sessions by default.
